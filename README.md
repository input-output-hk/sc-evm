# Proof of Concept EVM Sidechain Client

## Notice

As of 2023, IOG will no longer be updating or maintaining this repo.

After three months of experimentation with the proof-of-concept EVM sidechain testnet, we have gathered valuable
learnings from this experience and this innovative playground. New use cases and functionality were tested, feedback
from the community was gathered, and we are now shifting our focus back to the strategic evolution of our sidechains
approach.

All information included below is considered publicly available and is free to be leveraged by developers to fork it to
build and experiment with their own EVM sidechain solution. Should you have any questions, please reach out to our team
on our IOG Discord server.

The proof of concept (POC) EVM sidechain client is not production ready in its current form and use of it is entirely at
your own risk as this repository is not maintained. Please see [DISCLAIMER](./DISCLAIMER.md) for more information.

## Description

The Proof-of-Concept EVM Sidechain client is the sidechain client component described in the first version of the
sidechain toolkit specification. Written in Scala, the client runs as a sidechain to a Cardano network based on
Ouroboros-BFT.

### Documentation

Some documentation is available in the [docs](./docs) folder.

The technical specification is [here](./TECHNICAL_SPECIFICATION_v1.0.pdf).
