# Block execution metric

## Definition

Block execution regroups the following actions:

1. Executing the transactions contained in the block
2. Paying block reward
3. Updating `InMemoryWorldState`
4. Performing post-execution validations (check gas used, state root hash, receipts and log bloom)

Note: The block can be either generated by the node itself if it's a leader, or received via gossiping.

## Metrics

## Block execution time

The metric related to block execution is the time to execute a new block (on average).
The value is obtained by computing the average execution time for each block in intervals of 30 seconds.

Formula: `rate(sc_evm_block_execution_time_sum{namespace="$namespace"}[30s]) / rate(sc_evm_block_execution_time_count{namespace="$namespace"}[30s])`

## Number of errors during block execution

This metric is the number of errors that occurred during block execution.

At any time the value on the graph will correspond to the number of errors that occurred during the time range (the duration is defined by the range specified in the top-left corner of Grafana).
For example, within a period of 5 minutes, each point on the graph will display the number of errors that occurred in the 5 preceding minutes.

Formula: `increase(sc_evm_block_execution_errors_total{namespace="$namespace"}[$__range])`
